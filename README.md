## üåà What is this?

[`pokemonsay`](https://github.com/possatti/pokemonsay) is like [`cowsay`][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowsay] but for Pok√©mon only, written by [Lucas Possatti](https://github.com/possatti/).

This Docker image intends to bring the awesomeness of [`pokemonsay`](https://github.com/possatti/pokemonsay) to Docker and especially [whalebrew](https://github.com/whalebrew/whalebrew).
